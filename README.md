# Project-SOPT20Assist
We are the team named "DomDom" and formed as S.O.P.T 20th APPJAM team.<br/>
The project was conducted for two weeks with camps.<br/>
<br/>
Assist is the android mobile application system that supports the sport teams to manage their own using "gamification". Every individual users can be provided their own card(as like a player on the online games), based on their physical statics and the game records. There are additional helpful functions for support the teams of course.
> Gamification means the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement with a product or service.

Essentially, manager is one of the boring role of the team. Although this is a very important role, few people are willing to take on this role in this reason. Therefore, We have tried to encourage the voluntary participation of team members by making the manager role a fundamentally fun role.
